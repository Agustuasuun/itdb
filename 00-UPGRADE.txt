GENERAL INFO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most versions add changes to the Database. If upgrading several versions you 
must apply all the relevant SQL commands to the DB. Those commands are found
in the CHANGELOG file. 
For example, if updating from versino 0.14 -> 0.16  you must execute inside the
sqlite prompt the commands in the 0.14->0.15 section and after that the commands 
found in 0.15->0.16 section in the CHANGELOG file

INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Backup everything (the whole directory). You can use the "Get Full Backup" 
  link on the menu, or from the command like use something like: cp -a itdb/ 
  itdbold/ 

2.Extract the tar over the existing files. The file itdb.db should not be 
  overwritten (it won't normaly since there is no itdb.db file on the package).

3.run sqlite3 on the command prompt inside the itdb/data/ directory:
  sqlite3 itdb.db

4.on the sqlite> prompt paste the SQL instructions sequentialy depending on the 
  itdb version

5.type .q to quit the sqlite prompt

6.fix the ownerships/permissions if necessary as per original installation instructions
